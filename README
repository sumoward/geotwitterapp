
Backend code challenge

Requirements
Consume geo tweets from the Twitter stream API
Use Python or Ruby
Make nearby tweets available when a user provides coordinates
Make a basic UI
Use best practices

Bonus:
Render nearby tweets on a map
Make sure to be thorough and document everything. Please include links to all your code.
This challenge should represent approximately 4 to 6 hours of work.


    # you will need to add your own keys for twitter api in app.py
    consumer_key = ''
    consumer_secret = ''
    access_token = ''
    access_token_secret = ''

	requirements can be found in requirements.txt
	run the app with:
	python3 app.py

I completed the test using python 3.5. I normally work with ruby so i decided to refresh my python knowledge. The code should all meet pep 8.

As I took a minimalist approach Bottle was ideal as a web framework.
Bottle is a fast, simple and lightweight WSGI micro web-framework for Python. It is distributed as a single file module and has no dependencies other than the Python Standard Library.

Bottle comes with a fast, powerful and easy to learn built-in template engine called SimpleTemplate. This allowed me a bare bones ui without any use of bootstrap.

From the get go I decided to implement a map. While this was interesting it led to a number of issues.

Twitter is returning a reduced number of tweets with coordinates, this often means no tweets have coordinates in a sample. A work around using the place field was not possible in the alloted time.

In this case the app merely provides the tweeter and their tweet.

The map library gmplot is bugging out on windows.
